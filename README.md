# avalon-role-assigner

## Usage 

1. Clone this repo and locate yourself to the root

2. Before writing any code change the settings on your google gmail account at the following [link](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps): 
Change the switch for  `Allow less secure apps` to `ON`. This is a temporary change and will be restored to the default  `OFF` shortly after or once you are done running your script you can turn it back to OFF. 

You will get an email from google: 
```Critical security alert for your linked Google Account```

This is you changing your settings temporarily. 

3. In your root type the following:

```
python3 avalon.py
```

It should prompt you for everything.
_makes sure you are using a gmail account to send your roles out_ 
So long as all your emails are correct and you have done step 2 this should email your friends.

4. Get ready for a fun night! 

A Jupyter notebook has also been provided to avoid the prompts on the command line. It gives a bit of a walk though as well.
