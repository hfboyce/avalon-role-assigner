# avalon-role-assigner

## Usage 

1. Clone this repo and locate yourself to the root

2. Before writing any code change the settings on your google gmail account at the following [link](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps): 
Change the switch for Allow less secure apps to ON. This is a temporary change and will be restored to the default OFF shortly after or once you are done running your script you can turn it back to OFF. 

You will get an email from google: 
> Critical security alert for your linked Google Account

This if you changing your settings temporarily. 

3. In your root type the following:
```
python3 avalon.py
```

It should prompt you for everything and so long as all your emails are correct and you have done step 2, get ready for a fun night!
